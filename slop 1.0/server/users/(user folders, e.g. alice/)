# The user folders (e.g., alice/) under /server/users/ should be created as empty directories to store user-specific files. 

# The contents of the user folder (e.g., alice/) will be intentionally left blank for now. 

# Create the user folder structure as needed when users upload files. 

# Example for the user folder:
# /server/users/alice/ 
# /server/users/bob/ 
# /server/users/charlie/ 

# This file is intentionally left blank.
